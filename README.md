Movie Recommendation System:-
This repository contains a Movie Recommendation System built using Python and Streamlit. 
The application recommends movies to users based on their input and provides detailed insights with movie posters fetched dynamically from an API.

Features
* Personalized Recommendations: Suggests movies similar to the user's selected choice.
* Dynamic Posters: Fetches movie posters in real-time using The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
* Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for an easy-to-use interface.
* Error Handling: Handles API and file-loading errors gracefully.

Files
* app.py: Core Streamlit application code for the recommendation system.
* movie_dict.pkl: Dictionary containing movie details (required).
* similarity.pkl: Precomputed similarity matrix for recommendations (required).

How It Works
* Select a movie from the dropdown list.
* Click "Recommend" to get five similar movies along with their posters.
* Posters are dynamically fetched using the TMDB API.

Future Enhancements
* Add more recommendation techniques (e.g., collaborative filtering).
* Improve UI for a more intuitive experience.
* Include additional movie metadata in recommendations.


Acknowledgments
* The Movie Database (TMDB) for the API.
* Streamlit for providing an interactive app framework.
